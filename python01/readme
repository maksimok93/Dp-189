<h1>Practice</h1>
<h2>Task description</h2>
<p>Please write a script which prints pairs of numbers if their sum is = <code>10</code> for a given collection of numbers.<br>
For instance, if <code>python pairs.py 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7</code> is executed, the following is printed:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>3 + 7
4 + 6
5 + 5</pre></div>
<p>Please take into account, that the logic of calculation has to be defined outside main block.<br>
Assume that all arguments (if any) are valid numbers (exception handling will be covered later in the course).</p>
<h2>Review items</h2>
<p>Please send <code>pairs.py</code> along with commands you have used to test the functionality.</p>
